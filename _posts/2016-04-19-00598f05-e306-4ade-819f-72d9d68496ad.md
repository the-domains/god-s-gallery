"And who barricaded the sea behind doors when it burst out from the womb, when I clothed it with clouds and wrapped it in thick gloom, when established my limit for it and put its bars and doors in place, and I said, 'You may come this far, and no farther; Here is where your proud waves will stop?" - Job 38
